### GrackerAI — Generative Engine Optimization (GEO) for B2B SaaS

We build the platform that helps B2B SaaS companies get cited and recommended by AI search engines.

**What we do:**

- **Monitor** how ChatGPT, Perplexity, Claude, Gemini, Copilot, and Google AI Overviews talk about your brand
- **Analyze** where competitors get cited and you don't
- **Generate** AI-optimized content that earns citations from AI engines
- **Scale** AI visibility with programmatic SEO portals and automated publishing

**Why it matters:**

40% of B2B buyers now use AI assistants to research solutions. AI engines don't rank links — they recommend trusted sources. If AI can't find you, your customers won't either.

**Key numbers:**

- 6 AI engines monitored daily
- 60% average visibility increase in 90 days
- 3-5x higher conversion from AI search traffic
